# Wiki Explorator #

Wiki Explorator is a library for scientific research on wikis (and
other CMS, focus: Mediawiki) for interactive exploration, statistics
and visualization of (network) data.

It can be used for customized reports generation as well as
interactive wiki analysis.

## Caveat! ##

This is really old code. It was developed between 2007â€“2010 and was 
tested on Ruby 1.8. It should work on Ruby 1.9 and later but I am not 
sure about this.

It was hosted on Rubyforge (which does not longer exist) and originally
version control was with SVN.

## Getting started ##

The instructions in INSTALL may help you to get everything run, after
that the tutorial.pdf should give you an overview. 

You may test Wiki Explorator without installing using the online
version (see links).
