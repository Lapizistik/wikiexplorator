== ToDo

=== Deleted pages

The archive table is currently not parsed, i.e. deleted pages are
not handled correctly by the time-based filters and are not counted
for computing user collaboration.

To fix this Page and Revision objects must get a deletion time
instance variable. The deleted pages and revisions must be
reconstructed from the archive table, deletion time from the logging table 
(between lot of other stuff).

This implies to modify the timespan filters (we may need a second timespan) 
to get what we want (I may not want deleted pages to show up if timespan
is set to whole range).

Additionally the dangling links may point to deleted pages and have to
be handled specially.

=== Other DB-Engines

Currently only the Mysql DB engine is fully supported. For others some
(minor) changes are necessary, as e.g. for PostgreSQL some tables have
different names.

=== Additional Languages

Currently only english and german Mediawiki installations are supported,
i.e. internal links to pages of other namespaces than Main will not
be associated correctly in other languages.

To add other languages simply create a language file in 
<tt>mediawiki/languages/</tt>. See <tt>mediawiki/languages/de.rb</tt>
for description/example.

Please send me new language files as patch if done!

=== Testing

The testing suite is awful and out of shape.
